class Solution:
    def rearrangeArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        i=0
        j=1
        nums2=[0]*len(nums)
        for k in nums:
            if k<0:
                nums2[j]=k
                j+=2
            else:
                nums2[i]=k
                i+=2
        return nums2

i tried the partitioning alogirthm but it wasnt stable (it took more than n time complexity like n^2) so used extra space to solve it just by using another array
