1)Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
if u see the no exceeding it return it there itself

A STRING CAN WE A PALLINDROME BY CHECKING THE FOLLOWING:
STARTING FROM THE MIDDLE AND WORKING ALL THE WAY TO THE ENDS:
i)IT COULD BE OF ODD LENGTH: SO ONE MIDDLE ELEMENT
II)IT COULD BE OF EVEN LENGTH:2 MIDDLE
SO decrement the left and increment the right and check
