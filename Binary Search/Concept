Most of the question use the extensed version of simple binary search problem

1)to find floor and ceil of a number in an array the concept is simple
for floor-> in the condition a[m]<x it could be a possible answer right so store it that it just return it
for ceil->same
similarly for insert a number at the correct index

2)for finding the first and last position of a number in a sorted array
the concept is simple just do a simple binary search , if we want to find the starting index then in the condition if it equal to m
there just maintain an answer varaible of the position and decrement the right pointer to find the possible starting index
similar concept for ending also
